When making this, I ended up using the 0th index to add and delete elements (which I figured would become the 'top' of the stack)
since that seemed the easiest way!

In my popTopScoop() function in IceCreamConeModel, I made it so that we check for an
empty list there instead of in the pop() method itself because doing it that way
made more sense to me, in terms of design!
