Hi! This is the readme for Assignment 5.

I wasn't entirely sure what the assignment document meant when it suggested using the head of 
our linked list as the top of our stack, so I ended up using the 0th index to add and delete
elements (which I figured would become the 'top' of the stack). If there was another way
we were meant to implement that, that's my bad!

In my popTopScoop() function in IceCreamConeModel, I made it so that we check for an
empty list there instead of in the pop() method itself because doing it that way
made more sense to me, in terms of design!

I also had a quick question when it came to JPanels - I notice in other assignments 
where code for the GUI was given to us (like Assignment 2/3), there's often this
line of code where setFocusable(true) is written. I had that in my IceCreamMaker at
first, but I realised that commenting it out didn't change anything - it worked the 
same! The internet is a bit confusing on this, so I was wondering what 
setFocusable(true) is used for?

Hope grading is going well!
