This Java application models an ice-cream cone maker and an ice-cream shop (making use of the ice-cream maker!) by implementing data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues!

## Instructions:

### IceCreamMaker:

Navigate into the IceCreamMaker file and download/open `IceCreamMaker.jar`. 

Click on any of the 4 flavor buttons (strawberry, mango, chocolate, or pistachio) to add an ice-cream scoop of said flavor to the cone. If you want to change your experimental cone, click the purple buttons below the flavors to get rid of the top ice-cream scoop!

### IceCreamLine:

Go into the IceCreamLine folder and download/open `IceCreamShop.jar`. 

Click `Add New Order!` to generate new random ice-cream orders, and use the flavor buttons to make the cones (where IceCreamMaker is utilized)! Press `Serve the Next Order!` to give the customer the cone you made - a right order gives you 1 points while a wrong one takes away 5!  

Instructions are also given at the top end of the GUI for you to refer to!
